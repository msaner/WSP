        	<p>Eric's Pet Service's Inc. has been providing love and care to pets of all kinds since 2007.  We are the company to call if you are working long hours or are going out of town.  To us pets are more than just animals, they are family members and we want to provide the absolute best care for them.  </p>
            <p>I have been providing love and care to pets all of my life and have many years of experience working with dogs, cats, rodents, reptiles, and more!</p>
            <p>Does the though of putting your furry family member into a kennel while you are out of town makes you break into a cold sweat? Wipe that sweat away and turn your frown upside down, hire us to do the work for you. We can come to your house and walk your dog, clean your cats litter box, provide food and water and much more.  There is more information on the other pages so I urge you to browse the site and if you need <strong>anything</strong> call, email or text us. </p>
            <p>We are here for you!</p>
