		<h2>Pet Sitting $70/night</h2>
        <img src="images/jpg/pet-sitting.jpg" alt="pet sitting services happy dog">
        <p>We are available to care for any pet. Dogs, Cats, Rodents, Exotics, and more.</p>
        <p>A lot of pets have separation anxiety or just don't like being home alone so walking them a few times a day won't do the trick.  If you want your dogs to be taken care of 24/7, then you will need to use our Pet Sitting Services.</p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> We will arrange a first meeting so that we can become aquainted and let you take us on a tour of your home so you can point out where things like pet food are kept and let us know about any special requests you have while we are caring for your home and pets.  After that you let us know when and for how long you will be away and we will make sure we are there to see you off.  At that point we will go to great lengths to make sure that both your home and your pets are cared for with the highest degree of love and professionalism available.</p>
        <p>While staying at your home we will walk and play with your pets, feed them, give them fresh water and take care of any special requests that you have.  We always provide our own food, so you don't have to worry about coming home to an empty refigerator.</p>
		<strong>Other Included Services:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the mail and bring it inside your house</li>
            <li>Bring in the newspaper</li>

            <li>Turn indoor/outdoor lights on/off</li>
            <li>Send you regular updates and pictures</li>
        </ul>
