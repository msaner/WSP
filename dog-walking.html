		<h2>Daily Dog Walking $17/day</h2>
        <img src="images/jpg/dog-walker.jpg" alt="dog walker">
        <p>Count on us to walk your and play with your dog while you're away.  Avoid smelly pet accidents by hirring us to let your dog out during the day.  We will walk your dog, make sure they have water in their bowls and exercise them to release some of their pent up energy.  We encourage our clients to text or call us at any time to check in.  We would be happy to give you an update and send you a picture of your loved one.</p>
        	
            <h2>Pet Visits $17/visit</h2>
            <img src="images/jpg/pet-visit.jpg" alt="dog, cat, birds, pets we care for">
            <p>Going out of town? Work long hours? Don't put your pet in a kennel!</p>
            <p>Kennels are loud, expensive and lacking that personal touch and loving care that only Eric's Pet Services can provide.  Leave your pets in the comfort of their own home and have us come over a few times a day to take them for a walk, feed them, and play with them.</p>
            <p><strong>Complimentary Services:</strong> Because we like to pamper our human clients as well as our furry ones we offer the following <em>free</em> services when you book our Pet Visit service.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check the mail and bring it inside your house</li>
                <li>Bring in the newspaper</li>
                <li>Water house plants</li>
                <li>Turn indoor/outdoor lights on/off</li>
                <li>Send you regular updates and pictures</li>
